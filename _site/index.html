However, after a small preliminary analysis we found out that this is not the case. Indeed, beehives are globally increasing!</p> <p>But, even if bees are not declining on a global scale, they still face many threats and some countries are more affected than others. Threats such as habitat loss, toxic pesticides, parasites, diseases, climate change and invasive species, are still a big problem for bees and, from a broader perspective, for biodiversity.</p> <p>In this article we present a data-driven analysis of the habitat loss problem by providing a deeper insight on three important factors: crops, forests and agriculture.</p> <p>The reason behind this choice is that bees are not only important for producing honey and other bee products, but they also play an important role in the pollination process which is necessary for the development of crops and forests.</p> <p>Initially, we are going to show trends in the number of beehives and their correlation with those factors and, to conclude, we will present two kinds of model that we trained, one for beehives number prediction (given other features) and the other for beehives population forecasting.</p> <hr /> <h1 id="where-the-data-comes-from">Where the data comes from?</h1> <p>The dataset we are using is about global food and agriculture statistics and it is provided by the United Nations (<a href="http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#home" title="FAOSTAT">FAOSTAT</a>). It contains data about 200 countries and about nearly 80 categories(crops, forestry, animals, prices etc.), and in particular beehives.</p> <hr /> <h1 id="beehives-a-good-indicator">Beehives, a good indicator?</h1> <p>Obviously the number of beehives is not directly the total number of bees. Nonetheless we assume the numbers to be highly connected and are then a good indicator. The reason behind this assumption is that beekeepers build and destroy beehives based on bees population (, it doesn’t make sense to let bees be scattered in too many different beehives.?)</p> <p>(@ALEN, DID YOU SAY SOMETHING ELSE ABOUT THIS?)</p> <hr /> <h1 id="structure-of-the-article">Structure of the article</h1> <ol> <li><em>bees distribution</em>: in this section we are going to explore spatial and temporal distribution of beehives in the world</li> <li><em>correlated factors</em>: in this section we are going to analyse how other factors (crops and forests) are correlated to the number of beehives</li> <li><em>model prediction</em>: in this section we present the results of two models which goal is to predict the number of beehives and their population in the future (given the factors above).</li> </ol> </div> </section> <hr id='/features/02-analysis'> <section> <div class='lead'><h2 id="analysis">Analysis</h2> <h1 id="how-are-beehives-distributed">How are beehives distributed?</h1> <p>The number of beehives in the world is not equally distributed and is not constant over time.

We are presenting below the obtained results and providing some explanation of why these factors could be correlated.</p> <h4 id="crops">Crops</h4> <p>80% of flowering plants depend upon bees for pollination. Pollination is crucial because many of our vegetables, fruits and the crops that feed our livestock rely on it to be fertilised. Vegetables such as broccoli, asparagus and cucumber rely on the pollination of bees, as do apricots, strawberries, apples, tomatoes and almonds.</p> <p>(– plot here ???)</p> <h4 id="forestry-still-not-convinced-about-this">FORESTRY (still not convinced about this)</h4> <p>As highlighted previously, bees feed on pollen and nectar from flowers. But did you know that pollen and nectar from trees can be a very important part of their diet too, and that trees also depend on pollination from bees? We tried to see if this is reflected in our data and the main discovery is that in most of the countries with a big decrease in the number of beehives the percentage of the total land covered by forests is quite low, around 30-40%.</p> <p>– here the world map for forests with ratio</p> </div> </section> <hr id='/features/03-predictions'> <section> <div class='lead'><h2 id="predictions">Predictions</h2> <p>What will the future trend of beehives be like? We analyzed the dataset so far and noticed a steady increase since 1960. The future could look similar. We used the whole time series to predict the future of beehives until 2030 and see it increasing even more. But the future is not for granted. We saw a massive decrease of beehives in Europe and in the US between 1990 and 2000. This can happen anywhere and at any time. A lot of unpredictable factors and uncertainty influence beehive colonies.</p> <ul> <li>(HERE PREDICTION RESULTS)</li> </ul> </div> </section> <hr id='/features/04-conclusions'> <section> <div class='lead'><h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2> <p>In our project we answered several questions using different datasets. During the process we were surprised to disprove the common belief of beehives dying out. It was even possible to give a positive future if the trend continues. Nonetheless this is not true for every country. Especially in some european countries bees are still declining. We found out that bee colonies are not equally distributed and that a small portion of countries is responsible for most of the beehives and further showed a correlation between beehives and crops. To do all this, we needed to find various datasets and even talk to experts in the field.</p> <hr /> <h1 id="whodidwhat">#whodidwhat</h1> <ul> <li>Alen: Several plots, integrating further data into the analysis, Crops correlation</li> <li>Anel: Milestones, World maps, analysing beehives dataset, arima</li> <li>Francesco: Correlations, writing the Data Story, website</li> <li>Mateo: Correlations, Website, Plots on the webpage</li> </ul> </div> </section> <hr> </main> <footer> <div class='row'> <div class='col-lg-12'> <p>Copyright &copy; 2-bee 2019</p> </div> </div> </footer> </div> <script src='/assets/app.js'></script> </body> </html>
