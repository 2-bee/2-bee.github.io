## Analysis

# How are the beehives distributed?
The number of beehives in the world is not equally distributed and is not constant over time. We explore the change in the world, continents and certain countries. To start with, we introduce the world beehives population trend in an <span style="background-color: #ded1cf">interactive graph</span>.


{% include world_beehives.html %}

We can see that the number of beehives is actually increasing in the world, in fact the total number of beehives <span style="background-color: #ded1cf">increased 185.06% over the last 56 Years!</span>
But there could still be some differences between continents. Letâ€™s look at this. 

{% include stacked.html %}

Not only we see a huge increase on the asian and african continent, we see a massive drop in Europe and America. America recovered but Europe still suffers in order to increase their population.

We picked some of the most interesting countries, in particular the ones with high increase or decrease in the number of beehives. The graph shows the <span style="background-color: #c4e9f3">percentage changes</span> between the two picked year at the bottom. This graph is __interactive__ as well, so free feel to __explore__!

### **Around the world**
How beehives are distributed in the world, which countries are the best when it comes to beehives? 
Below we present the top 10 countries, both for number of beehives and for the ratio (number of beehives in country / total surface area of country).

{% include top10.html %}



The _interactive_ plot above is showing insights into the countries with the biggest beehives population. We see that most of these countries are big in terms of size like India, China, Russia, and America. This is not a huge surprise since they have a lot of agricultural areas that bees can exploit.  Although it is important to look at top ten by beehives number, we don't believe this is a fair competition for smaller countries, this is why we will show the top ten by density - just press the button in the graphic! Do you see how the plot is changing? 
We clearly see a shift towards smaller countries, only turkey preserves its spot in the top ten and Korea made it on the podium!

### But, what factors influence beehives? 
We took into consideration some of the available categories in the dataset, mainly related to crops, and for each one we analysed the correlation with beehives. 
We are presenting below the obtained results and providing some explanation of why these factors could be correlated.

#### Crops
80% of flowering plants depend upon bees for pollination. Pollination is crucial because many of our vegetables, fruits and the crops that feed our livestock rely on it to be fertilised. Vegetables such as broccoli, asparagus and cucumber rely on the pollination of bees, as do apricots, strawberries, apples, tomatoes and almonds.
