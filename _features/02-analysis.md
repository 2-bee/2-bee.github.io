## Analysis

# How are the beehives distributed?
The number of beehives in the world is not equally distributed and is not constant over time. We explore the change in the world, continents and certain countries. To start with, we introduce the world beehives population trend in an interactive graph.


{% include world_beehives.html %}

We can see that the number of beehives is actually increasing in the world, in fact the total number of beehives increased 185.06% over the last 56 Years!
But there could still be some differences between continents. Letâ€™s look at this. 

{% include stacked.html %}

Not only we see a huge increase on the asian and african continent, we see a massive drop in Europe and America. America recovered but Europe still suffers in order to increase their population.

We picked some of the most interesting countries, in particular the ones with high increase or decrease in the number of beehives. The graph shows the percentage changes between the two picked year at the bottom. This graph is __interactive__ as well, so free feel to explore!

### **Around the world**
How beehives are distributed in the world, which countries are the best when it comes to beehives? 
Below we present the top 10 countries, both for number of beehives and for the ratio (number of beehives in country / total surface area of country).

{% include top10.html %}



We observe an interesting top ten. Most of these countries are big in terms of size like India, China, Russia and America. But we also have some smaller ones like Spain. The countries are interestingly split throughout the world. So beehives play an important role for every economy. 
Since we believe this is not a fair competition we will show the top ten countries by country size. Here we clearly see a shift towards smaller countries like XXXX.

### But, what factors influence beehives? 
We took into consideration some of the available categories in the dataset, mainly related to crops, and for each one we analysed the correlation with beehives. 
We are presenting below the obtained results and providing some explanation of why these factors could be correlated.

#### Crops
80% of flowering plants depend upon bees for pollination. Pollination is crucial because many of our vegetables, fruits and the crops that feed our livestock rely on it to be fertilised. Vegetables such as broccoli, asparagus and cucumber rely on the pollination of bees, as do apricots, strawberries, apples, tomatoes and almonds.
