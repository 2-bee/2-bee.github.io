## Analysis

# How are beehives distributed?
The number of beehives in the world is not equally distributed and is not constant over time. We explore the change in the world, continents and certain countries.


### **Over time**

{% include world_beehives.html %}

We can see that the number of beehives is actually increasing in the world, in fact the total number of beehives increased 185.06% over the last 56 Years!
But there still could be some differences between continents. Letâ€™s look at this. 

------

{% include stacked.html %}

Not only we see a huge increase on the asian and african continent, we see a massive drop in Europe and America. America recovered but Europe still suffers in order to increase their population.

------

We are now picking some of the most interesting countries, in particular the ones where the number of beehives is decreasing and showing how much they change with variations in the range of considered years.

### **Around the world**
How beehives are distributed in the world, which countries are the best when it comes to beehives? 
Below we present the top 10 countries, both for number of beehives and for the ratio (number of beehives in country / total surface area of country). 

------
- plot top 10 countries for number of beehives + plot top 10 countries for number of beehives divided by total land surface area(ratio)


We observe an interesting top ten. Most of these countries are big in terms of size like India, China, Russia and America. But we also have some smaller ones like Spain. The countries are interestingly split throughout the world. So beehives play an important role for every economy. 
Since we believe this is not a fair competition we will show the top ten countries by country size. Here we clearly see a shift towards smaller countries like XXXX.

### But, what factors influence beehives? 
We took into consideration some of the available categories in the dataset, crops and forestry, and for each one we analysed the correlation with beehives. 
We are presenting below the obtained results and providing some explanation of why these factors could be correlated.

#### Crops
80% of flowering plants depend upon bees for pollination. Pollination is crucial because many of our vegetables, fruits and the crops that feed our livestock rely on it to be fertilised. Vegetables such as broccoli, asparagus and cucumber rely on the pollination of bees, as do apricots, strawberries, apples, tomatoes and almonds.

#### FORESTRY (still not convinced about this)
As highlighted previously, bees feed on pollen and nectar from flowers. But did you know that pollen and nectar from trees can be a very important part of their diet too, and that trees also depend on pollination from bees?
We tried to see if this is reflected in our data and the main discovery is that in most of the countries with a big decrease in the number of beehives the percentage of the total land covered by forests is quite low, around 30-40%.
