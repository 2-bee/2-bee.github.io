## Predictions
What will the future trend of beehives be like? We analyzed the dataset so far and noticed a steady increase since 1960. The future could look similar. We used the whole time series to <span style="background-color: #c4e9f3">predict the future</span> of beehives until 2030 and see it will be increasing even more. But the future is not set in stone. We saw a massive decrease of beehives in Europe and in the US between 1990 and 2000. This can happen anywhere and at any time. A lot of <span style="background-color: #c4e9f3">unpredictable factors and uncertainties</span> influence beehive colonies.
